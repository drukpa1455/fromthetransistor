## Study Suggestions

### Before Starting This Section
1. **Start with nand2tetris** if you need a gentler introduction to digital logic
2. **Watch Ben Eater's 8-bit CPU series** for intuition about how transistors become computers
3. **Try the visual CPU simulator** to see real hardware in action

### While Working Through This Section
1. Use **DigitalJS** for quick circuit visualization
2. Join the **r/FPGA community** for questions
3. Keep the **Verilator documentation** handy for simulation issues

### Next Steps
- **Learn Verilog basics** through HDLBits before starting Section 2
- **Build a simple 8-bit CPU first** as practice before the ARM implementation
