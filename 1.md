# Section 1: Intro: Cheating our way past the transistor (0.5 weeks)
This initial section provides a foundational understanding of transistors, their theory, and their practical applications. It includes how Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are built using transistors and introduces emulation using Verilator, which will enable anyone with a computer to experiment and learn.

# Lesson 1: So about those transistors and FPGAs
Objective: Understanding the foundational components of digital electronics: transistors and FPGAs.

## Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs):
A Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) is a three-layer semiconductor device that can amplify electronic signals and control electrical power. It consists of a collector, a base, and an emitter region. BJTs come in two main types: NPN (Negative-Positive-Negative) and PNP (Positive-Negative-Positive). The NPN BJT has two pn junctions: one between the base and emitter (BE junction) and another between the base and collector (BC junction). The PNP BJT has similar junctions, but the polarities are reversed. The flow of current in a BJT is controlled by the current or voltage applied to the base terminal.
```bash

BJTs have various applications in electronic devices, including amplifiers, oscillators, and digital logic circuits.

## Field-Effect Transistors (FETs):
Field-Effect Transistors (FETs) are three-terminal devices that use an electric field to control the flow of current. They have high input impedance and can provide voltage gain. There are two main types of FETs: Junction Field-Effect Transistors (JFETs) and Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs).
```bash

```bash

|  D  |     |  S
|     |     |   
----------------
G - Gate, D - Drain, S - Source
```
In JFETs, the current flow is controlled by the voltage applied across the pn junction. In MOSFETs, the current flow is controlled by the voltage applied to the gate terminal, which modulates the conductivity of the channel between the source and drain terminals. MOSFETs are widely used in digital integrated circuits due to their high packing density and low power consumption.

## FPGA Architecture:
A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can be configured by the user to perform specific digital functions. Unlike Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are custom-built for specific applications, FPGAs are programmable and flexible. They consist of an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) interconnected through programmable routing channels.
```bash

```
CLBs contain look-up tables (LUTs), flip-flops, multiplexers, and other logic elements that can be configured to implement desired digital circuits. The interconnection between CLBs allows the creation of complex digital designs. FPGAs are commonly used in prototyping, rapid development, and low-volume production.

## Assignments
1. Exploring Transistors: Research further about the structure, operation principles, and applications of BJTs and FETs. Understand how they are used to create digital logic gates.
2. Understanding FPGA: Investigate the structure of an FPGA. Understand the role and operation of Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) and Input/Output Blocks (IOBs). Also, learn about the Look-Up Tables (LUTs) in the context of FPGAs.

# Lesson 2: Emulation with Verilator
Objective: Getting started with Verilator, a free and open-source Verilog HDL simulator.

## Verilator
Verilator is a powerful Verilog hardware description language (HDL) simulator that allows for fast simulation and verification of digital circuits. It translates synthesizable Verilog code into optimized C++ or SystemC programs for simulation.

## Assignments
1. Installation: Install Verilator using the appropriate command for your system.
2. Getting Started with Verilator: Write a simple Verilog code for an AND gate. Then use Verilator to convert this Verilog code into a C++ model. Simulate the model and understand the output.
```verilog
module and_gate (input wire a, b, output wire out);
    assign out = a & b;
endmodule
```
To compile and run:
```bash
verilator -Wall --cc and_gate.v --exe main.cpp
make -j -C obj_dir/ -f Vand_gate.mk Vand_gate
./obj_dir/Vand_gate
```
`main.cpp` is a testbench that you would write to drive the inputs and monitor the output of the AND gate.

By the end of this section, you should have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of transistors, FPGAs, and hardware simulation using Verilator. These concepts will form the basis for the subsequent sections, where we will delve deeper into digital design and computer architecture.
